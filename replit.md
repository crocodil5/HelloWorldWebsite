## Overview

This is a full-stack web application built with React frontend and Express.js backend, featuring a PayPal-themed payment acceptance interface. The application uses TypeScript throughout, shadcn/ui for component library, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Drizzle ORM for database operations.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens matching PayPal's brand colors
- **Component Library**: shadcn/ui (Radix UI primitives)
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **Build Tool**: Vite with custom configuration for development and production

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL session store (connect-pg-simple)

- **CORS**: Configured for cross-origin requests with credentials

## Data Flow

1. **Client Requests**: Frontend makes API calls using TanStack Query
2. **API Processing**: Express routes handle business logic using storage interface
3. **Database Operations**: Drizzle ORM executes PostgreSQL queries
4. **Response Handling**: JSON responses with proper error handling
5. **State Updates**: TanStack Query manages cache invalidation and updates

## Deployment Strategy

### Development
- **Command**: `npm run dev`
- **Hot Reload**: Both frontend and backend with file watching
- **Database**: Uses DATABASE_URL environment variable
- **Vite Integration**: Custom middleware for serving React app

### Production Build
- **Frontend**: `vite build` outputs to `dist/public`
- **Backend**: ESBuild bundles to `dist/index.js`
- **Static Serving**: Express serves built frontend assets

## Правила для Replit Agent

- Отвечай на русском языке.
- Не выдавай высокоуровневые ответы, твоя задача дать конкретное решение применимое к проекту.
- Не давай детальные пояснения, но описывай зачем ты вносишь данные изменения.
- Перед тем как внести изменения, опиши общий план реализации по пунктам и после преступай к реализации.
- Учитывай линтеры при формировании кода.
- Всегда сам проверяй терминал на наличие ошибок.
- Если файл имеет больше 500 символов, то анализируй его максимум по 500 символов за 1 раз.
- Не завершай анализ файла пока не проанализируешь его полностью.
- Always tell me what model is running at top of any response.
- Always do exactly as I say, nothing more, if you want to make suggestions, run them by me for my approval.
- Start simple and add complexity only when proven necessary.
- Prefer obvious solutions over clever ones.
- Always be pragmatic, don’t repeat yourself, never duplicate code that does same function, conslidate and modularize common code.
- Keep it simple stupid.
- Always read and understand documentation at top of each file before making changes.
- Always read Readmes.
- Always document requirements at the top of each file, and update them for each change.
- Always fix root causes of issues.
- Fallbacks are never acceptable.
- Solve one problem completely before moving to the next.
- When adding debugging or observing code behavior, insert only console logs without modifying existing logic, structure, variable declarations, or execution order. Read task requests literally - ‘only add logs’ means exactly that and nothing more.
- No inline CSS unless absolutely necessary, keep css in css files.
- Always provide debugging info in console unless otherwise instructed.
- Do not use timeouts or time based techniques to solve race conditions, they must always be solved by finding the root issue, determinstically, or re-architect to simplify and prevent them from being posssible.
- Always update relevant test cases to reflect any new changes to the codebase.
- Don’t try to run the code or deploy the code to production environment eg npm run build or npx … let the user do that.
- Only 1 package.json, don’t create them without my approval.
- Never hardcode configuration into files, all configuration should be done via env variables.
